Ride-sharing app analysis

In this dataset, I analyzed data collected from a ride-sharing app (like Uber) during 2010 (January-December). The data contains 16,383 observations from 1,247 users and includes 28 original variables and 3 featured variables. The business task was to mine the data to find opportunities for business improvements for the next business year. I answered several questions to analyze the data:

<p> -Analyzed the distribution of rides by driver and taxi ID to identify the most active drivers and taxis.
<p> -Identified the busiest and slowest hours of the day for ride requests.
<p> -Identified the busiest and slowest days of the week for ride requests.
<p>	-Analyzed the distribution of rides by type of rider (e.g. regular vs. new) to identify patterns in rider behavior and preferences.
<p>	-Analyzed the distribution of rides by type of start (e.g. ASAP, reserved, delayed) to identify patterns in rider behavior and preferences.
<p>	-Analyzed the distribution of rides by unique user ID to identify the most active riders and track their behavior over time.
<p>	-Compared the performance of different drivers based on different metrics (e.g. ride completion rate, customer satisfaction, on-time arrival rate) to identify top performing drivers.

<p>These analyses were done using two data analytic tools - Microsoft Excel (Spreadsheet) and Power BI. The sheet contains the report while Power BI was used to create a driver's performance dashboard. Each sheet in the spreadsheet focuses on different aspects (questions) of the analysis.
Here are the column (variable) headings and brief explanations to indicate what they contain:

<p> Journey_id: Unique identification of each ride.
<p> User_id: Unique identification of each user.
<p> Driver_id: Unique identification of each driver.
<p> Taxi_id: Unique identification of each car.
<p> Level: Types of ride service level.
<p> Start_type: Trip schedule of each ride.
<p> Day: Day of the week extracted from start date (the date and time recorded for the trip).
<p> Start_at: The date and time when the trip took place.
<p> Driver_arrived_at: Time driver arrived after order was placed.
<p> Start_lat: Pick-up location latitude.
<p> Start_lon: Pick-up location longitude.
<p> End_at: Date and time trip ended.
<p> End_lat: Drop-off latitude.
<p> End_lon: Drop-off longitude.
<p> End_state: Completion type of the ride.
<p> Driver_start_lat: Driver location latitude after accepting order.
<p> Driver_start_lon: Driver location longitude after accepting order.
<p> Currency: Country's currency.
<p> Price: Amount user paid.
<p> Duration: Order start time - trip end time.
<p> Cost/driver-earnings: Real amount the driver takes home.
<p> Source: User's type of phone.
